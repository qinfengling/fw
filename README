Sunela Firmware
===============

This repository contains the Sunela firmware. Both a version ("fw") that runs
on the real hardware and a simulator ("sim") that runs under Linux, using SDL,
are built.

Most of the firmware is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. See
COPYING for more details.


WARNING
-------

This firmware is under development and not yet intended for real-life use !
Among other issues, test coverage is very poor (there aren't even proper
regression tests), some code needs major cleanup, and "secrets" are not hidden
at all.


Build instructions
------------------

To do: document setting up the toolchain (we're based on OpenBouffalo, but
there are some issues we need to work around.)

-------------

The following packages are needed (the names given here are for Ubuntu 22.04):
