Sunela Firmware
===============

This repository contains the Sunela firmware. Both a version ("fw") that runs
on the real hardware and a simulator ("sim") that runs under Linux, using SDL,
are built.

Most of the firmware is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. See
COPYING for more details.
