Sunela Firmware
===============

This repository contains the Sunela firmware. Both a version ("fw") that runs
on the real hardware and a simulator ("sim") that runs under Linux, using SDL,
are built.

Most of the firmware is distributed under the terms of the MIT License. See
COPYING for more details.


WARNING
-------

This firmware is under development and not yet intended for real-life use !
Among other issues, test coverage is very poor (there aren't even proper
regression tests), some code needs major cleanup, and "secrets" are not hidden
at all.


Build instructions
------------------

To do: document setting up the toolchain (we're based on the Bouffalo SDK, but
there are some issues we need to work around.)


Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages are needed (the names given here are for Ubuntu 22.04):

Liberation fonts: fonts-liberation
Font configuration utility fc-list: fontconfig
OpenType/TrueType BDF converter otf2bdf: otf2bdf
Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL2): libsdl2-dev
GNU Crypto library: libgcrypt20-dev
PyNaCl: python3-nacl


Running on the Sipeed M1s Dock
------------------------------

We run the Sunela firmware on the M0 (RV32) core of the Bouffalo BL808. The
Bouffalo SDK provides the USB stack.

Prerequisites:

Toolchain: riscv64-unknown-elf
Probable source (for Ubuntu): apt install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf

Bouffalo SDK (for BL616, BL618, BL808, and others):
git clone https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk.git

Check out the Bouffalo SDK at the same level as the fw/ directory.

Build:

cd sdk
make

Transfer to on-board Flash:

If the left USB port ("OTG") is connect to anything, disconnect it.
Connect the right USB port ("UART") to the PC from which you will flash.
If the serial console (e.g., picocom) is connected, disconnect it (e.g., with
^A^Q).

If the USB-serial device of the M0 core is at /dev/ttyACM1, just run

make flash

If the device is elsewhere, use

make flash COMX=/dev/ttyelsewhere

To test the code:

- Connect the right USB port of the M1s to a PC, for power and, optionally, the
  serial console:
  picocom -b 2000000 /dev/ttyACM1

- reset the M1s by pressing the RST button (under the board)

- Connect the left USB port of the M1s to a PC
  Note: USB power of both ports of the M1s Dock is directly connected to the
  board's VBUS rail. If connected to different PCs, power can flow from one,
  through the M1s, to the other.

The device should now enumerate as "Qi Hardware Sunela BL808" (20b7:ae72).
